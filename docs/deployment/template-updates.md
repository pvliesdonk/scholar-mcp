# Working Through a Template Update

This project is generated from
[fastmcp-server-template](https://github.com/pvliesdonk/fastmcp-server-template)
and tracks it. Once a week the `copier-update` workflow runs `copier update
--trust` and opens a pull request on the `copier/update` branch. Automated
runs advance one template major at a time, so a project several majors
behind sees one pull request per major, each with its own upgrade notes; a
manual dispatch with an explicit `vcs_ref` jumps straight to a chosen
release. This page is the procedure for that pull request,
whether you work through it yourself or hand it to a coding agent (the
`applying-template-updates` skill under `.agents/skills/` is the same
procedure in agent-invocable form).

## What an update is for

In most copier projects an update is a merge: you accept the template's
changes and settle the conflicts. Here the template is authoritative.
In every file `copier update` re-renders, each line outside a sentinel
block belongs to the template, and the update brings this project back to
the template at the target version.

Conflict markers show only where a template change and a local change
collide. Local content written into template-owned lines that the template
did not change in this jump carries forward silently, so an update with no
conflicts can still leave the project forked. That drift comes from this
project's own earlier commits, not from the template. An update is done
when every template-owned file either conforms or has a Decay issue in
this project that says why it does not yet.

## What the pull request carries

- The version delta (`vA.B.C` → `vX.Y.Z`) and a compare link on the
  template repository.
- The template's release notes for the target version, collapsed.
- The `UPGRADING.md` sections that apply to the jump, collapsed, with a
  link to the full file at the target ref. This is the template's record
  of the work `copier update` cannot do.
- The list of files that carry conflict markers, if any.
- The drift report, `.copier-template-drift.md`: every template-owned file
  that differed from the template outside its sentinel blocks before this
  update, with the diff and the commits that last touched those lines.
- The resolution policy: the template side wins everywhere outside the
  regions this project owns.

## The order of work

1. **Read the upgrade notes first.** Every `UPGRADING.md` section in the
   body names something a person must do: rename a variable, add a
   secret, rewrite a seeded test, add a `.gitignore` line. Do those steps
   on the `copier/update` branch before touching anything else; a note
   that is skipped now is a failure later, on a run nobody connects to
   this update.
2. **Read the drift report.** `.copier-template-drift.md` is the list of
   work; the conflict markers are the part of it the template also touched.
   Where a drifted file carries a conflict marker, the report shows which
   side of the hunk is local drift. If the report is missing or could not
   be computed, run `uv run --script scripts/check_template_conformance.py --rev
   origin/main --ref <previous version>` to produce it.
3. **Resolve conflict markers.** `copier update` runs a three-way merge and
   leaves diff3-style markers where a template change and a local change
   collide: `<<<<<<< before updating` (the local side), `||||||| last
   update` (the common base), `=======`, and `>>>>>>> after updating` (the
   template side). Resolving a hunk means keeping one side and deleting
   all four marker lines and the base block between `|||||||` and
   `=======`. Which side wins turns on whether the hunk is inside a sentinel
   block, and on what kind of block it is:

   - **Inside a sentinel block that invites your content, the local side is
     yours and stays.** These are the `DOMAIN-*`, `CONFIG-*`, `PROJECT-*` and
     `DOCKERFILE-*` families. Some of them wrap template-shipped content you
     extend rather than replace (`PROJECT-EXTRAS`, `DOCKERFILE-UV-EXTRAS`), so
     a template change inside one is possible: read both sides and keep your
     additions.
   - **Inside a `GENERATED-*` region the template side wins**, and you do not
     resolve it by hand. Those regions are written by
     `scripts/gen_config_surface.py`, which re-runs at the end of the update
     and rewrites them from your own config.
   - **Outside every sentinel block the template side is correct by policy**:
     a local edit to a template-owned region is drift, and the displaced
     content is handled as in the next step.
4. **Conform every drifted file.** For each file in the drift report,
   restore the template's lines and move this project's content into the
   sentinel block the file declares for it, or into a module or page the
   template does not render. When that needs design work beyond the update,
   keep the local lines in that file and open a Decay issue in this project
   naming the file and the hunks; that issue is the only reason a file
   stays drifted.
5. **Check the seeded-once files.** Copier's `_skip_if_exists` list names
   files that are written on the first `copier copy` and never touched
   again by `copier update`. They are absent from the diff even when the
   template changed them. The update writes `.copier-seeded-changes.md` at
   the repository root (the pull request body embeds it): a diff of every
   seeded path between the previous and target template versions, or an
   explicit statement that no seeded file changed. Work through that file
   and apply what applies by hand, keeping your local content. When the
   report says it could not be computed, fall back to the compare link and
   the "Before every upgrade" recipe in the template's `UPGRADING.md`. The
   seeded paths, for reference:

   `.claude-plugin/**`, `src/scholar_mcp/tools.py`,
   `src/scholar_mcp/resources.py`, `src/scholar_mcp/prompts.py`,
   `src/scholar_mcp/domain.py`, `tests/conftest.py`,
   `tests/test_smoke.py`, `tests/test_cli.py`,
   `tests/public_import_surface.txt`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/releases/**`,
   `LICENSE`, `packaging/mcpb/manifest.json.in`,
   `packaging/mcpb/pyproject.toml.in`, `packaging/mcpb/src/server.py`,
   `packaging/mcpb/build.sh`, `.gitignore`, `.vale.ini`,
   `.vale/styles/config/vocabularies/Base/accept.txt`,
   `config-presentation.domain.yml`, `tests/test_config_wizard_domain.py`,
   `src/scholar_mcp/static/app.src.html`.

   Four more skip-listed paths are generated, not seeded: `.env.example`,
   `packaging/env.example`, `examples/*.env` and
   `docs/javascripts/config-wizard/wizard-spec.json`. The update
   regenerates them from the config surface at its end, so never edit
   them by hand; `scripts/gen_config_surface.py --check` in CI catches a
   stale copy.

   The list above is a snapshot; the authoritative one is
   `_skip_if_exists` in the template's `copier.yml` at the target ref.
   Treat a template change to a seeded file as a change to apply, never as
   noise to ignore: the template ships these files as complete starting
   points, and corrections to them reach this project only this way.
6. **Refresh the lock file.** `uv lock` after any floor change (the
   upgrade notes say when), then `uv sync --all-extras --all-groups
   --locked`.
7. **Run the update gate.** This is wider than the everyday gate, because
   an update can leave drift that only these checks see:

   ```bash
   git diff --check
   git grep -nE '^(<<<<<<<|=======|>>>>>>>)'
   uv lock --check
   uv sync --all-extras --all-groups --locked
   uv run python scripts/gen_config_surface.py --check
   uv run ruff check .
   uv run ruff format --check .
   uv run mypy src/ tests/
   uv run pytest -x -q
   uv run mkdocs build --strict
   uv run pre-commit run --all-files
   uv run --script scripts/check_template_conformance.py
   ```

   An MCP Apps project also runs `uv run python scripts/vendor_spa.py
   --check`. The last command lists every template-owned file that still
   differs from the template outside its sentinel blocks; each one must
   have a Decay issue from step 4. CI runs the other checks on the pull
   request.
8. **Merge.** The branch is recreated on the next weekly run, so leave
   nothing uncommitted on it.

## Working with a coding agent

Give the agent the pull request number and ask it to invoke the
`applying-template-updates` skill. The skill walks the steps above and
stops where a decision is yours: a conflict inside a sentinel block, an
upgrade note it cannot perform (a secret to add, a repository setting),
and any seeded-file change it is not certain applies to this project. It
reports what it applied and what it skipped (with reasons), plus the
outcome for every file in the drift report. Review that report against the pull request body
before merging.

## When the template looks wrong

It sometimes is. Tell a template defect from this project's drift by
reproducing without this project's content: render the target version
with this project's answers and run the failing check there.

```bash
copier copy --trust --defaults --data-file .copier-answers.yml \
  --vcs-ref <target version> <template source> /tmp/pristine
```

- **The fault shows in that render**: a template defect. Open an issue on
  the template repository with the reproduction.
- **The fault shows only with this project's content in template-owned
  lines**: this project's debt. Conform the file, or open a Decay issue
  here.
- **This project needs room the template does not give**: a template
  feature request. State the need, not the content it would let this
  project keep, and file it once the update conforms.

None of these resolves the update. The update does not wait for them
either. `FORKING.md` covers the last resort of detaching from the
template altogether.
