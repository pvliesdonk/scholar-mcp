# Transfer links

This server has transfer links when `create_download_link` and `create_upload_link` appear in the [tools reference](../reference/tools/index.md). A transfer link is a one-time URL for one file. The bytes travel over plain HTTP between the server and whoever holds the link; the conversation carries only the URL and its expiry, so a large file never passes through the model. The link route sits outside authentication, which makes the URL itself the credential: the [security model](../security-model.md) says what the tools behind it reach.

## For the person holding a link

A tool call returns `url` and `expires_in_s`. A download link answers one `GET`; the response carries the file as an attachment, so a browser saves it rather than showing it:

```bash
curl -o report.pdf "https://mcp.example.com/transfer/<token>"
```

An upload link takes the file's bytes as the request body of one `POST` (or `PUT`), raw, not as a form:

```bash
curl -X POST --data-binary @diagram.png "https://mcp.example.com/transfer/<token>"
```

What the answers mean:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `200` | The transfer happened. For a short grace window the same link still answers, so a download that stalled part-way can be fetched again; after it the link is gone. |
| `404` | No such link: unknown, expired, already used, or minted for the other direction. The server does not say which. |
| `409` | Another request is using this link at this moment; retry shortly. |
| `413` | The upload is larger than the server accepts; the link stays usable for a smaller one. |

Where the file goes on an upload is fixed when the link is minted; whoever uploads cannot change it.

## For the operator

- **The route.** `/transfer/{token}` is registered beside the MCP endpoint and outside the authentication middleware. No bearer token or sign-in is asked for; the token in the URL is the authorization. It is 256 bits of randomness. A used or expired link answers like one that never existed.
- **The public URL.** Links are built from `SCHOLAR_MCP_BASE_URL`, which the server requires before it registers the route at all; under a path prefix the link carries the prefix, so the [reverse proxy](reverse-proxy.md#a-path-prefix) must route `/transfer/` to the server the same way it routes the MCP path. Stdio has no route: the tools are absent there, not failing.
- **The store.** Tokens live in the server's key-value store (`SCHOLAR_MCP_KV_STORE_URL`), so replicas that share the store share the links.
- **The variables.** The five settings below are read from the environment under this server's prefix; the [configuration reference](../reference/configuration.md) carries the authoritative list for this server, and the defaults here are fastmcp-pvl-core 10.1's.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SCHOLAR_MCP_TRANSFER_TTL_DEFAULT_S` | `3600` | Link lifetime when the caller gives none. |
| `SCHOLAR_MCP_TRANSFER_TTL_MAX_S` | `86400` | Ceiling; a longer requested lifetime is capped to it. |
| `SCHOLAR_MCP_TRANSFER_GRACE_TTL_S` | `60` | How long a used link stays valid for a retry of a stalled transfer. |
| `SCHOLAR_MCP_TRANSFER_LEASE_S` | `60` | How long a transfer may hold the link before a crashed handler's claim is released. |
| `SCHOLAR_MCP_TRANSFER_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` | `104857600` | The per-upload size cap (100 MiB). |

A link pasted into a chat or written to a log is a live credential until it is used or expires, since nothing else guards the route. A shorter default lifetime narrows that window; the model can still ask for less with the tool's `ttl_s` argument, never for more than the ceiling.
