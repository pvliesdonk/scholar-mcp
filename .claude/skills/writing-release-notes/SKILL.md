  Use when drafting or revising a release-notes page under docs/releases/ —
  the Release Prepare workflow's notes job invokes it for every release PR
  (rc and stable alike), and a human may invoke the Release Notes dispatch
  for a re-draft or backfill. Walks the API-driven research fan-out (commits
  to PRs to linked issues, never commit subjects), the evidence contract,
  the per-minor page format, and the Vale loop, and ends with pages written
  into the working tree for the calling workflow to land — never a direct
  push.

# Writing release notes

The pages under `docs/releases/` are the canonical human-facing narrative of
each release; the GitHub release body is a summary plus a link to them, and
`CHANGELOG.md` is the machine-written commit-level audit trail. This skill is
the contract for producing a page: what to research, what counts as evidence,
what the page looks like, and which gates it must pass. Every requirement
below was established empirically by trial runs recorded on
pvliesdonk/fastmcp-server-template#347; where this skill says "must", a trial
produced the failure the rule prevents.

## Inputs

You are given, or must derive first:

- `TAG` / `VERSION` — the stable release (e.g. `v3.2.0` / `3.2.0`). At
  prepare time (an open release PR, tag not yet created) these name the
  release being prepared; an rc target still drafts its stable minor's page.
- `MINOR` — the series (e.g. `3.2`); the page is `docs/releases/MINOR.md`.
- `PREV` — the highest stable tag strictly below the target version
  (series-aware, `sort -V`); empty on a first release.
- `RANGE_END` — where the research range ends, always a commit SHA. After
  a release this is the tagged commit; at prepare time it is the release
  PR's source commit, because the tag does not exist yet. The evidence rules below are identical either
  way — only the range endpoints move. A prepare-time draft is refreshed
  (branch force-pushed) alongside any re-dispatch of the release PR.
- Mode — **new page** (the minor's page does not exist: write the whole
  page), **patch append** (the page exists but does not yet cover the
  target patch release, `Z > 0`: add one section inside the patch
  sentinels; leave the rest of the page alone unless it is factually
  wrong), or **redraft** (the page already covers the target — an `X.Y.0`
  page drafted at prepare time, or any target whose `RELEASE-SUMMARY`
  marker an earlier candidate already wrote: update the covering section
  and its summary block in place, and never append a duplicate section
  for a release the page already covers).
- Watermark — an existing page carries an invisible
  `<!-- notes-range-end: SHA -->` comment recording where its last
  accepted draft's research ended. This is the incremental-research
  anchor for the modes below.
- Full-redraft flag — the operator may set it on either dispatch
  (Release Prepare threads it through to the notes job); it suspends
  the watermark's cache role for that one run (see the override below).

## Incremental research (patch and redraft modes)

The accepted page is the cache; do not re-research a range the page
already covers. When the page carries the watermark:

- If the watermark SHA equals `RANGE_END`, the page's researched content
  is already current: do no re-research and leave the prose alone, but
  still apply the date backfill from the page-format section — it derives
  from tag existence, not from the research range. Say what you did in
  your final report either way; the calling workflow treats an unchanged
  existing page as success, and a backfill-only change lands like any
  other draft.
- Otherwise research only `WATERMARK..RANGE_END` (the same fan-out and
  evidence rules, over the delta), fold the findings into the existing
  narrative — extend a theme, add one, or leave prose untouched when the
  delta is stamps and mechanics — and verify claims the delta might have
  invalidated rather than re-deriving the whole page.
- Always move the watermark to `RANGE_END` when you touch the page, and
  write it (once, at the top of the page after the front matter or title)
  when you create a page.

A page without a watermark predates this contract: research the full
`PREV..RANGE_END` range once, and add the watermark with the result.

**Full-redraft override.** When the run's inputs say full redraft, the
watermark loses its cache role for that run only, and the calling
workflow has already **emptied the page** (after snapshotting it):
write the complete page from scratch, exactly as in new-page mode.
Research the full range the page covers — from the highest stable tag
strictly below the minor's first release (`X.Y.0`, series-aware via
the tags API; the whole history on a first series) through
`RANGE_END` — and re-derive every part of the page under the current
contract: the summary block for each release the page covered (the
minor's tags, read via the API, tell you which), the theme sections,
the upgrade section, the patch sentinels and their sections, and the
watermark at `RANGE_END`. The previous page remains readable through
the API at the branch ref for reference, but write from the
re-research, never by restoring it — a full redraft that reproduces
the old prose with word-level touch-ups is the override not honoured.
The index entry lives in a separate file and stays. This is the
operator's remedy when this skill's own rules changed after a page was
accepted: the incremental path above deliberately preserves accepted
prose, so contract improvements never reach an already-covered range
without this override. The flag is off by default on every entry
point — a refresh is incremental unless the operator sets it, either
on the Release Prepare dispatch (threaded through to the notes job) or
on the Release Notes dispatch directly.

## Non-negotiables

1. **No evidence, no narrative.** Every causal claim ("X was slow because
   Y", "this was driven by user demand") must trace to a linked issue or PR
   you actually read, and the page links it. A claim you cannot source gets
   dropped, not hedged. Concrete numbers appear only verbatim from a source.
   Attribute quoted judgements (for example "[per the maintainer]" with the
   link) rather than presenting them as your own analysis.
2. **Output is reviewed before it publishes, never pushed live.** The
   dominant failure mode is plausible-but-wrong rationale, and a
   confabulated "why" on a published docs site is worse than no narrative.
   The page reaches a human either inside the release PR's diff (the
   primary flow — the release review includes the notes evidence check) or
   as a standalone notes PR (backfill); write for that review either way.
3. **Never touch `CHANGELOG.md`.** It is machine-generated and stays that
   way. The two artifacts answer different questions: "what landed" versus
   "should I upgrade".
4. **Never write from `git log`.** Commit subjects are the input ceiling this
   whole pipeline exists to break. A draft whose sections mirror the commit
   list is the recognised failure ("a haiku summary of the git log") — if you
   notice the page reading like grouped commit subjects, the research phase
   was skipped; go back.
5. **Write the net delta, not the development journey.** The page answers
   "what changes when I upgrade from `PREV`", so a state that existed only
   *between* two commits of the range is invisible to every reader: a
   feature new in this release is described as it ships, never through the
   fixes that hardened it inside the same range; a regression introduced
   and fixed within the range is not a fix worth reporting; work superseded
   or reverted before `RANGE_END` does not appear at all. Evidence-linked
   is necessary, not sufficient — development progress is mildly
   interesting and still not release information. An intermediate PR may
   still be *cited* where it is the best evidence for how the shipped
   behaviour works; what must not appear is the sequence of intermediate
   states as narrative. The summary block is the strictest surface: it
   positions the release against `PREV` only, never against an rc or an
   unshipped intermediate ("rebuilt", "now fixed") no reader ever ran.

## Research procedure

### 1. Enumerate the range through the API, not local git

- Commit list: `gh api "repos/OWNER/REPO/compare/PREV...RANGE_END"`
  (paginate past 250 commits; if PREV is empty this is the whole history —
  fall back to the release's own compare link or the full commit list). The
  compare API accepts a tag or a commit SHA as either endpoint, so the same
  call covers post-release and prepare-time drafting. The compare API is
  authoritative; a shallow local clone silently truncates ranges.
- Commit to PR: `gh api "repos/OWNER/REPO/commits/SHA/pulls"` — never regex
  `(#N)` out of subjects (breaks on squash subjects without the suffix and
  on passing mentions).
- PR to issues: the PR's closing-issues references (GraphQL
  `closingIssuesReferences` on the PR object) — never grep `Closes #N` from
  bodies; UI-made links have no text form.

### 2. Group before you read deeply

Build the theme map from structure first:

- **Epics are the primary grouping input.** For each linked issue, check for
  a parent (native sub-issues; epics carry the `epic` label). An epic whose
  children closed in this range is one theme, and its issue form's "What
  changes for the user" paragraph — written at epic creation — is the seed
  for both that theme's section and the release summary. Verify that
  paragraph against what actually landed; edit it, do not just copy it.
- The release **milestone** (or the `ships-atomically` label) marks work
  that was planned to ship together — treat it as one story.
- A bump of a **first-party upstream** (the `fastmcp-pvl-core` library, or
  the copier template behind a `chore(copier): update` commit) is a theme
  lead of its own, researched through the upstream repository — see the
  dedicated rule below.
- Everything else falls into themes by subject (each significant feature,
  contributor-driven changes, platform/infrastructure work, fixes). Where a
  repository has no epics or milestones, this thematic grouping is the whole
  map — degrade gracefully; do not invent structure.

### 3. Fan out — one research pass per theme

A single agent holding the whole range regresses to commit subjects, because
reading the linked issues does not fit alongside drafting. Dispatch **parallel
research subagents, one per theme**. Each walks its theme's commits → PRs →
issue bodies **and comments**, and returns a compact structured brief:

- what shipped, in user terms, with the PR/issue links;
- the motivating problem, quoted from the issue body where possible;
- who reported or drove it: the issue's `user.login` and
  `author_association`, not just commit authors;
- exact enablement: env vars, defaults, config keys, tool names;
- any concrete numbers (timings, sizes, counts) with their source;
- the feature's docs page(s), and whether they changed in this range;
- the **shipped end state only**: where later commits in the range
  superseded earlier ones, brief the final behaviour and mark the
  earlier intra-range states as superseded — they are evidence trail,
  not findings (the net-delta non-negotiable).

The synthesiser writes **from the briefs only**.

### 4. Attribution comes from issue authorship

Commit authors miss most outside contributors: people who file the issue that
the maintainer then implements are invisible in `git log`. Report reporters.
Corollary: do not infer outside demand from an issue the maintainer filed —
if an outside PR preceded the maintainer's tracking issue, the honest
attribution is the PR.

A quote's citation names the artifact where the quoted words verbatim
appear, written by the person you attribute them to — fetch that artifact
and check both before writing the citation. A maintainer-filed tracking
issue often restates a contributor's words; citing it turns the
contributor's report into the maintainer's, which is exactly the
misattribution above wearing a link.

### 5. Synthesis pass, with licence to regroup

After the briefs return, look across them before writing: separate
deliverables may be one recipe with several delivery channels (write the
"which do I want" paragraph, not three bullets), and a fix filed under one
scope may really belong to another theme's story. Conventional-commit scopes
are not the outline; the reader's questions are. This is also where the
net-delta non-negotiable gets applied across briefs: collapse any surviving
journey narration into the shipped end state before a section is written.

### 6. First-party dependency bumps are research leads, not dead ends

A commit that raises the `fastmcp-pvl-core` floor or applies a template
update (`chore(copier): update to vX.Y.Z`) changes this server's behaviour
while carrying no content of its own — the change lives in the upstream
repository, and a downstream issue restating it may not exist. Do not let
the fan-out dead-end there:

- Read the old and new versions from the range's endpoints (the
  `pyproject.toml` constraint, `uv.lock`'s pinned entry, or the copier
  answers file's `_commit`), through the API like every other
  file-at-ref read. The upstream repository comes from the dependency's
  project URLs or the answers file's `_src_path`.
- Research the upstream range between those two versions through the
  upstream repo's own release artifacts: its `docs/releases/` pages and
  GitHub release bodies are themselves evidence-linked — read them
  rather than re-deriving upstream history, and follow into upstream
  PRs/issues only where they are thin or missing.
- Surface only what an operator or user of **this** server experiences
  on upgrade — a security-posture change, a flipped default, new
  behaviour of a shared helper (redirect handling, error shapes) — in
  the theme where a reader would look for it, never as a bare
  "dependencies were bumped" list. Link the upstream evidence directly;
  the evidence rules do not weaken across a repository boundary.
- Third-party bumps stay out unless a linked local issue makes one a
  story (a CVE fix, an outage remedy).
- The net-delta rule crosses repos too: an upstream change absorbed
  and already compensated for within this same range is invisible.

## Writing the page

Each significant feature answers, in this order:

1. **What is it** — for someone who has never heard of it.
2. **Why does it fit this server** — almost always a verbatim quote from the
   motivating issue; it is never in a commit.
3. **How do I enable it** — exact env vars, defaults, config; a reader should
   be able to act without opening another page (but link the guide too).
4. Then, and only then, the tool/API surface it added.

A list of tools shipped is the failure mode, not the deliverable.

### Upgrade / breaking-changes section

Do **not** trust `!` markers or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footers — trials found
them wrong in both directions. Derive the section from the actual surfaces
between `PREV` and `RANGE_END`, read through the API — you have no local
git (`gh api "repos/OWNER/REPO/contents/PATH?ref=REF" -H "Accept:
application/vnd.github.raw"` returns the file body directly, no decoding
pipeline needed; the ref accepts a tag or a commit SHA, so the same call
covers prepare-time drafting where the tag does not exist yet) —
classified against the breaking-change policy in `CLAUDE.md` (operator
surface and public library interface, assessed against the last stable):

- import surface: diff `tests/public_import_surface.txt` at the two refs;
- operator surface: diff `.env.example` / the config surface at the two refs;
- tool surface: compare the registered-tools docs at the two refs (not
  breaking on its own, but worth a migration note when behaviour moved).

Where your classification disagrees with a commit's marker, follow the
classification and say so in the PR body.

### Docs links — verify before linking

Every feature with a docs page links it, not only the flagship. Locate pages
rather than assuming them, and **check each linked page is current**: a
feature whose code changed in the range while its guide did not is a
candidate staleness bug. Do not link a page you found stale as if it were
authoritative; list every staleness candidate in the PR body (observation
voice, `[unverified]` where you did not confirm) so the maintainer can file
or fix — do not file issues yourself from an automated run.

## Page format

One page per minor: `docs/releases/MINOR.md`. Patch releases append a
section to the same page (dated per the tag-existence gate below), so a
minor's story stays in one linkable document.
Skeleton for a new page (the comment markers are load-bearing — the publish
workflow extracts summary blocks by tag, and later patch drafts insert only
inside the patch sentinels):

    # 3.2

    <!-- RELEASE-SUMMARY v3.2.0 START -->
    One short paragraph, user-facing: what this minor means for someone
    deciding whether to upgrade. Seeded from the epic form's summary where
    one exists. This block becomes the GitHub release body.
    <!-- RELEASE-SUMMARY v3.2.0 END -->

    ## <theme sections, per the writing rules above>

    ## Upgrading

    <the derived upgrade section; omit heading if truly nothing>

    <!-- PATCH-RELEASES-START -->
    <!-- PATCH-RELEASES-END -->

A patch section goes inside the patch sentinels, oldest first, as:

    ## v3.2.1 (2026-08-20)

    <!-- RELEASE-SUMMARY v3.2.1 START -->
    One paragraph: what this patch fixes and who should care.
    <!-- RELEASE-SUMMARY v3.2.1 END -->

    <evidence-linked detail, same rules as above>

The `(2026-08-20)` date suffix follows the same tag-existence gate as the
shipped-claim rule below: a prepare-time patch draft, whose tag does not
exist yet, writes the bare `## v3.2.1` heading, and the post-release draft
appends the real date. The parenthesised form is deliberate: the shipped
Vale packs reject em dashes (`Google.EmDash`, `ai-tells.EmDashUsage`), so
an em-dash separator here would fail the skill's own prose gate — write
page prose without em dashes generally rather than spending vocabulary
or rewrites on them.

For a **new** page, also add the minor to the list in
`docs/releases/index.md` (newest first, between its markers; the first real
entry replaces the seeded placeholder line). Do not edit
`mkdocs.yml`: the navigation is project-owned. If the nav has no
Release Notes entry yet, note that in the PR body instead of adding one.

Never claim the target version has shipped before it has. The gate is
whether the target's stable tag exists at drafting time (read it through
the API when unsure). At prepare time it does not — an rc target's stable
may still be weeks out — so a prepare-time draft gives the target's index
entry and page no "(released <date>)" qualifier and no past-tense shipping
claim. A post-release backfill or re-draft, whose target tag does exist,
states the real date — that is the later draft the target earns its date
from. That later draft need not target the shipped version: every draft,
whatever its target, also backfills the date onto any index entry or patch
heading whose tag now exists but which an earlier pre-tag draft left
undated, using the tag's own timestamp as the source. The backfill covers
what the draft's checked-out tree carries: on the default branch that is
every series, so dates lag by at most one default-branch drafting run; a
draft on a `release/X.Y` branch may have been cut from an old tag that
lacks newer pages, and the entries missing there wait for the next
default-branch draft. An operator who wants a date sooner dispatches a
re-draft or hand-edits the page.

## Quality gates — run them, do not assume them

- **Vale** is the prose gate, including the `ai-tells` LLM-prose detector:
  run `vale docs/releases/` (the binary and synced style packs are provided
  by the workflow; locally, `vale sync` first) and iterate until clean.
  Distinguish the two hit classes: real prose findings get rewritten;
  domain vocabulary the spell-checker does not know goes into
  `.vale/styles/config/vocabularies/Base/accept.txt` (add it in the same
  change) — never contort prose around a vocabulary hit.
- **Strict docs build**: `uv run mkdocs build --strict` must pass.

## Output

Leave the working tree holding only: the target release page, any other
release page or `docs/releases/index.md` that the date backfill touched
(the index also in new-page mode), any `accept.txt` additions, and your
proposed PR body in
`.release-notes-pr-body.md` at the repository root (the workflow's mechanical
step commits the docs paths — onto the release PR's prep branch in the
primary flow, or as a standalone notes PR from the body file in backfill
mode — and discards the body file). The PR body must carry:

- the release tag and compare link;
- a claim-by-claim evidence summary (or a statement that every inline link
  is the evidence), so the human review is a link check, not archaeology;
- your breaking-change classification and any disagreement with `!` markers;
- docs-staleness candidates found in the research;
- anything you could not source and therefore left out.

**Honest failure beats confident junk.** If the range has too few linked
issues to support a narrative, write the modest factual page the evidence
supports. If you cannot produce even that, change nothing and say why in
your final report — in the primary flow the workflow then fails loudly and
the operator re-runs or consciously releases with skip_notes; a backfill
run simply opens no PR.
