"""Bump versioned manifests to match the semantic-release version.

Invoked by python-semantic-release via ``[tool.semantic_release] build_command``.
PSR sets ``NEW_VERSION`` in the environment and, because ``server.json`` and
``uv.lock`` are listed in ``[tool.semantic_release] assets``, PSR stages and
commits them together with ``pyproject.toml`` + ``CHANGELOG.md`` as the single
release commit — which is the commit it then tags.

The script runs inside PSR's Docker action container (python:3.14-slim), which
has Python but no ``jq`` — hence Python rather than a shell+jq wrapper.

This file is TEMPLATE-OWNED: it re-renders on every ``copier update``, so a
fix to the shared bumpers (``server.json``, ``uv.lock``) arrives whole rather
than half — the ``assets`` half landing in the re-rendered ``pyproject.toml``
while the script half never arrives (#325).  Projects that ship additional
versioned manifests (e.g. a Claude Code ``plugin.json``, an ``.mcp.json``, or
other lockstep JSON/TOML files) put their code between the
``DOMAIN-MANIFESTS-HELPERS`` markers (module-level helpers) and the
``DOMAIN-MANIFESTS`` markers (the calls, inside ``main()``), and list each
extra path in ``pyproject.toml`` ``[tool.semantic_release] assets``.  Only
content inside those markers survives an update; anything added outside them
lands in template-owned code and is at the mercy of the next merge.
