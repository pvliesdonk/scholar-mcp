## Conventions

- Python 3.11+
- `uv` for package management, `ruff` for linting/formatting (line length 88)
- `hatchling` build backend
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`
- Google-style docstrings on all public functions
- `logging.getLogger(__name__)` throughout, no `print()`
- Type hints everywhere
- Tests: `pytest` with fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`

The automated Claude review runs **only after CI passes** — if CI is red, no
review is posted. Fix CI and push; the review runs on the next green run.

## Hard PR Acceptance Gates

Every PR must pass **all** of the following before merge. Do not open or push a PR until these are green locally:

1. **CI passes** — `uv run pytest -x -q` all tests pass
2. **Lint passes** — run in this exact order: `uv run ruff check --fix .` then `uv run ruff format .` then verify with `uv run ruff format --check .`. Always run format *after* check --fix because check --fix can leave files needing reformatting.
3. **Type-check passes** — `uv run mypy src/ tests/` reports no errors
4. **Patch coverage ≥ 80%** — Codecov measures only lines added/changed in the PR diff. Run `uv run pytest --cov=src/scholar_mcp --cov-report=term-missing` and verify new code is exercised. Use the path form for `--cov`: a dotted module target (e.g. `--cov=scholar_mcp.config`) makes coverage.py import the module speculatively, which leaves an orphaned beartype import hook behind and aborts the whole session at conftest load. Add tests for every uncovered branch before pushing.

5. **Structural quality (diff) passes** — new/changed code must introduce no new structural violations (complexity, too-many-*, security). Enforced on the diff only, so pre-existing code is never blocked. Run before pushing:
   ```bash
   uv run diff-quality --violations=ruff.check \
     --options="--extend-select=C901,PLR0911,PLR0912,PLR0913,PLR0915,S" \
     --compare-branch=origin/main --fail-under=100
   ```
   `# noqa: C901` (etc.) with a one-line justification is the escape hatch for genuinely irreducible new code.
6. **Docs updated** — `README.md` and `docs/**` reflect any user-facing changes in the same commit
7. **Manifest version lockstep** — `server.json`, `.claude-plugin/plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and `.claude-plugin/plugin/.mcp.json` must all carry the same version. The release workflow bumps them atomically via PSR; manual touches require updating all three.


## Pre-commit Hooks

This project ships a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` that runs ruff (check + format), mypy on `src/` and `tests/`, gitleaks secret scanning, and standard whitespace/YAML/JSON checks — aligned with the `ci.yml` lint/typecheck/secrets jobs so a clean pre-commit run implies a clean CI lane.

- **Install once per clone:** `uv run pre-commit install`.
- **Run on demand before pushing:** `uv run pre-commit run --all-files`. A green run is a precondition for gates #2 and #3 above.

- **Structural gate runs at push time:** the `structural-diff-gate` hook (pre-push stage) runs the command above automatically. `uv run pre-commit install` wires it via `default_install_hook_types`. A clean local push implies a clean CI `structure` job — same command, same range, as long as your PR targets `main` (the hook hardcodes `origin/main`; CI compares against the PR's actual base branch).

- **Never bypass with `--no-verify`.** A failing hook means the same check will fail in CI; fix the underlying issue rather than silencing it.

Domain-specific additions (shellcheck, yamllint, project-specific linters, additional file checks) belong between the `DOMAIN-HOOKS` markers at the end of the config, never outside them; hooks inside that block on top of the shipped defaults survive `copier update`.


## Structural health

The structural gate stops *new* debt; these practices and the advisory audit keep existing debt visible.

**Local-shape rules (checkable while you write):**

- Keep functions short and single-purpose; if a function needs a comment to explain a *section*, that section is a function.
- Nesting beyond ~3 levels is a smell — extract or invert/early-return.
- Five parameters is the ceiling; past it, pass an object or split the function.
- A new responsibility is a **new collaborator, not a longer class**. When a class grows a second reason to change, that reason belongs in its own unit.

**Advisory audit (on demand — run before substantial work in an unfamiliar area, or when about to touch a flagged module):**

```bash
uv run --with radon python -m radon cc -s -n C src/    # complexity hotspots (grade C+)
uv run --with radon python -m radon mi -s src/         # maintainability index
uv run --with vulture vulture src/                     # dead-code candidates
```

Each analyzer is optional and degrades gracefully if absent. `vulture` over-reports on importable/decorated/framework-registered code — **confirm before deleting** and keep a whitelist.

**When you notice decay outside the current change's scope** — a god class forming, a dead branch, a leaking abstraction, a name that no longer matches behaviour, or an audit hotspot — do **not** fix it inline (scope creep) and do **not** pass over it silently. **Open an issue** using the **Decay** form (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/decay.yml`): What / Where / Why it compounds / Suggested direction.

Constrain issues to **decay that will compound**, not anything imperfect. The diff-gate blocks new debt; these issues are the refactor-later backlog for pre-existing debt — neither blocks the current PR.


## PR Discipline

**Every PR must have at least one associated issue.** If the work doesn't have one yet — a bug found in the wild, an opportunistic cleanup, a small improvement — create the issue first, then open the PR with `Closes #N` (or `Refs #N`) in the body. A single PR may close multiple issues (`Closes #A, closes #B`) — bundling related fixes is fine; the rule is "no orphan PRs", not "one PR per issue". This keeps the changelog, release notes, and cross-repo history coherent.

Trivial exceptions: pure typo fixes and automated dependency bumps (Renovate) may skip the issue.

<!-- TEMPLATE-TRACKING-START -->
**The bot reviewer (claude-review) is a merge gate, not a pair reviewer.** Local review must be complete before the PR opens. If it finds anything on first run, the local review was incomplete — that is a discipline failure to investigate, not "address-and-move-on." Run a local code-review pass on the cumulative diff before `gh pr create`; it is not a substitute.
<!-- TEMPLATE-TRACKING-END -->

## GitHub Review Types

GitHub has two distinct review mechanisms — **both must be read and addressed**:

- **Inline review comments** (`get_review_comments`): attached to specific lines of the diff. Appear in the "Files changed" tab. Use `get_review_comments` to fetch these.
- **PR-level comments** (`get_comments`): posted on the Conversation tab, not tied to a line. Review summary posts, bot analysis, and blocking issues are often posted here. Use `get_comments` to fetch these.

Always fetch both before declaring a review round complete.

## Documentation Discipline

Every issue, PR, and code change must consider documentation impact. Before closing any issue or creating any PR, check whether the following need updating:

- **`docs/design/`** — internal design specs and architecture decisions (the authoritative dev reference). Any new feature, changed behavior, or architectural decision must be reflected here. Not part of the published site.
- **`README.md`** — user-facing documentation. New env vars, tools, resources, prompts, CLI flags, or configuration options must be documented here.
- **`docs/` site pages** — the published documentation site. New or changed MCP tools/resources/prompts, new env vars, new installation methods or deployment options.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — managed by semantic-release from conventional commits.
- **Inline docstrings** — new or changed public API methods need accurate Google-style docstrings.

**Rule: code without matching docs is incomplete.**

## Documentation Conventions (user-facing vs internal)

`docs/` is the **published, user-facing documentation site** (mkdocs + mike).
Everything under `docs/`, plus **`README.md`**, is operator-facing prose and is
**Vale-linted** in CI and pre-commit — keep it clean.

**Internal / developer docs are not user-facing and are not linted.** They live
under a fixed set of subtrees, excluded from both the published site and Vale:

- `docs/design/` — design specs and architecture notes
- `docs/decisions/` — architecture decision records (ADRs)
- `docs/superpowers/` — agent working specs and plans (also gitignored)

This boundary is declared in three places that **must stay in lockstep** (the
`template-ci` "vale exclusion-scope lockstep" job asserts the CI glob and the
pre-commit exclude match): the mkdocs `exclude_docs:` block, the `vale` CI
step's `vale_flags` glob (`--glob=!docs/{superpowers,design,decisions}/**` — one
glob with brace alternation, because Vale honors only a single `--glob`), and
the `- id: vale` pre-commit hook's `exclude:` regex
(`^docs/(superpowers|design|decisions)/`). The set is fixed by convention — do
not add per-project exclusions; put internal docs in one of the subtrees above.

## Logging Standard

### Scope

This standard governs **first-party code only** — `src/scholar_mcp/` and
`tests/`. Two categories of log output are explicitly **out of scope**; do not
try to make them conform:

- **FastMCP middleware stack** (`fastmcp-pvl-core` timing / logging /
  error-handling middleware): emits conforming, bare-event-name-first lines
  automatically. Tool-call lines carry `tool=<name>`. Governed by
  `fastmcp-pvl-core` itself (see pvliesdonk/fastmcp-pvl-core#90); no
  first-party code needed.
- **`uvicorn.access` and `mcp.server.lowlevel.server` log lines**: upstream
  transport / SDK output. `configure_logging_from_env` raises their effective
  level to `WARNING`, suppressing per-request `INFO` output at the default
  level; at `DEBUG` they are reset to `NOTSET` so the root logger governs
  their effective level via propagation (pvliesdonk/fastmcp-pvl-core#91).
  `uvicorn.error` is intentionally not suppressed — it carries startup and
  bind failures. Do not silence or reformat any of these — they are out of
  scope by design.

### Framework
- Standard library `logging` throughout. Every module: `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`.
- No `print()` for operational output. No third-party logging libraries.
- FastMCP middleware handles tool invocation, timing, and error logging automatically.
- All first-party logging goes through FastMCP's `configure_logging_from_env()` for uniform output. `FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL` is the single log level control; the `-v` CLI flag sets it to `DEBUG`. `FASTMCP_ENABLE_RICH_LOGGING=false` switches to plain/JSON output.

### Log Levels
| Level | Use for |
|-------|---------|
| `DEBUG` | Detailed internals: cache hits, parameter values, config resolution |
| `INFO` | Significant operations: service startup, configuration decisions (tool calls logged by middleware) |
| `WARNING` | Degraded but continuing: API errors with fallback, missing optional config, unexpected data |
| `ERROR` | Failures affecting the primary result. Use `logger.error(..., exc_info=True)` when traceback is needed |

### Exception Handling
- All exceptions must be caught and handled. No bare `except:`. Always specify the exception type.
- Expected errors (HTTP 4xx, missing data): catch, log, return user-facing error string.
- Optional enrichment failures: catch, log at `DEBUG` with `exc_info=True`, continue.
- Primary result errors: catch, log at `WARNING` or `ERROR`, return error string.
- `ErrorHandlingMiddleware` is a safety net. If it catches something, that's a bug to fix.

### Message Format
- Pseudo-structured: `logger.info("event_name key=%s", value)`
- Event name as first token (snake_case), then key=value pairs via `%s` formatting.
- Never use f-strings in log calls (defeats lazy evaluation).

## Config & Customization Contract

Domain configuration composes `fastmcp_pvl_core.ServerConfig` inside your domain config class (see `src/scholar_mcp/config.py`).  Add domain fields between the `CONFIG-FIELDS-START` / `CONFIG-FIELDS-END` sentinels, populate them in `from_env` between the `CONFIG-FROM-ENV-START` / `CONFIG-FROM-ENV-END` sentinels, and enforce their invariants in `__post_init__` between the `CONFIG-VALIDATE-START` / `CONFIG-VALIDATE-END` sentinels.  Validation belongs in `__post_init__` rather than `from_env` because it then also covers a direct `ProjectConfig(field=...)`; `env_float` / `env_int` bounds check only the env-sourced value, are inclusive-only, and cannot express cross-field rules.  The dataclass is frozen — read fields, don't assign (use `object.__setattr__` if a field must be normalised).  Never inherit from `ServerConfig`; always compose.

Env var prefix is `SCHOLAR_MCP_` — all env reads go through `fastmcp_pvl_core.env(_ENV_PREFIX, "SUFFIX", default)` so naming stays consistent.

- **Domain CLI subcommands** go in the `# DOMAIN-COMMANDS-START` / `-END` block in `cli.py` (like `CONFIG-FIELDS` in `config.py`). Register them as `@app.command()` and use function-local imports for domain modules. The block is preserved across `copier update`.

### Config wizard

`docs/javascripts/config-wizard/wizard-spec.json` drives the guided-setup page. It is **generated**, produced by `scripts/gen_config_surface.py` on every `copier copy`/`copier update` and re-verified by `scripts/gen_config_surface.py --check` in CI — never hand-edit it. The runtime (`wizard.js`, `generators.js`, `wizard-spec-schema.json`, the generic tests) is template-owned and re-rendered the same way it always was.

To change what the wizard asks:

- **A domain setting your project reads** — give its `ProjectConfig` field (between the `CONFIG-FIELDS-START`/`-END` sentinels in `config.py`) a `metadata={"help": ..., "tags": (...)}`. The generator's AST scan discovers it from there; no wizard-spec edits needed.
- **A var the scan cannot see** (a deprecated alias no longer read inside `ProjectConfig.from_env`, or something read outside it entirely) — declare it in `config-presentation.domain.yml` instead.
- **Coverage is enforced, not automatic** — the generator fails loudly (`SystemExit`, naming the var and its tags) if a collected `Var`'s tags match no env-file section, rather than silently dropping it from every generated file. Giving a domain field a tag no section lists is a config-presentation bug, and this catches it at generation time instead of shipping an undocumented var. There is, however, **no orphan check**: a stale or mistaken entry in `config-presentation.domain.yml` that nothing actually reads will generate into the wizard and env files anyway. Keep that file's contents matched to real reads yourself.

### mcpb install screen

`packaging/mcpb/manifest.json.in`'s `user_config` and `server.mcp_config.env` objects are **generated** the same way (`kind: mcpb-user-config`): both derive from one curated `fields:` map, so a screen field and its env wiring cannot drift apart, and hand edits to those two objects are overwritten on the next generation — the rest of the manifest stays yours. The template baseline shows a deliberately minimal screen (server name, log level). Curate this project's screen in `config-presentation.domain.yml` under `files:` → `packaging/mcpb/manifest.json.in` → `fields:`: map an env var name to `{id: ..., title: ..., type: string|boolean|number|directory|file, required: ..., default: ..., sensitive: ...}` (everything but `id` falls back to the var's own metadata), or to `null` to drop a baseline field. A `files:` entry for a path the template does not declare is taken wholesale — that is how a project drives its own additional install-channel manifest from the same source of truth.

### Tool icons

Drop SVG / PNG / ICO / JPEG files into `src/scholar_mcp/static/icons/` and bulk-attach them to registered tools via `fastmcp_pvl_core.register_tool_icons(mcp, {"tool_name": "filename.svg"}, static_dir=...)` at the end of `register_tools()` — or attach at decoration time with `@mcp.tool(icons=[make_icon(STATIC / "x.svg")])` (where `STATIC = Path(__file__).parent / "static" / "icons"` is a shorthand you define at module level). The scaffold ships an empty `static/icons/` directory; commented-out wiring lives in `tools.py`.

### Dockerfile extension points

These sentinel blocks in `Dockerfile` are preserved across `copier update`. Add domain-specific apt packages, uv extras, state subdirs, and volume mounts inside them:

- `# DOCKERFILE-APT-DEPS-START` / `-END` — extra apt packages installed into the runtime image
- `# DOCKERFILE-UV-EXTRAS-START` / `-END` — `--extra <name>` flags added to both `uv sync` invocations (deps cache layer + project install — adding only to one breaks the cache layer)
- `# DOCKERFILE-STATE-DIRS-START` / `-END` — state subdirectories created under `/data` (chowned to the runtime user)
- `# DOCKERFILE-VOLUMES-START` / `-END` — `VOLUME` declarations on the final image

### Release manifest extension points

`scripts/bump_manifests.py` bumps `server.json` and refreshes `uv.lock`'s self-version entry inside the release commit, so the tag never points at a manifest whose version lags it. These sentinel blocks in that script are preserved across `copier update`. Add bumps for this project's own version-coupled manifests (a Claude Code `plugin.json`, an `.mcp.json`, another lockstep JSON/TOML) inside them:

- `# DOMAIN-MANIFESTS-HELPERS-START` / `-END` — module-level helpers (use `_load` / `_dump` for JSON so the byte format matches what `scripts/gen_config_surface.py` asserts)
- `# DOMAIN-MANIFESTS-START` / `-END` — the calls, inside `main()`, where `version` is in scope

Every path bumped there must also appear in `pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.semantic_release] assets`, or PSR leaves it out of the release commit. The two are checked against each other by `tests/test_release_contract.py`, so a manifest named in one and not the other fails the gate rather than shipping a release commit with a stale file in it.


## Claude Code plugin channel

`.claude-plugin/plugin/` ships this server as a Claude Code plugin: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (identity + version) and an exec-form `.mcp.json` that launches the released PyPI package with `uvx --from <pkg>==<version>`. Both manifests are version-coupled to the release — `scripts/bump_manifests.py` bumps them in the release commit and `[tool.semantic_release] assets` stages them, so the marketplace entry published by the release workflow always installs the version it points at (`tests/test_release_contract.py` gates that pairing). The `env` block in `.mcp.json`, the plugin README, and any `skills/` directories are project-owned content: the files are seeded once and never re-rendered by template updates. Values in `env` may reference plugin `userConfig` entries as `${user_config.<id>}` declared in `plugin.json` — exec-form fields only; shell-form command strings reject the substitution.

To generate the plugin's configuration screen from the config surface instead of hand-editing it, declare a `files:` pair in `config-presentation.domain.yml`: the plugin.json path with `kind: claude-plugin-user-config` and a `fields:` map (same field specs as the mcpb screen above), plus the `.mcp.json` path with `kind: claude-plugin-env` and `fields_from:` naming the first entry. One fields map then drives both the `userConfig` object and the `${user_config.<id>}` env wiring, and `scripts/gen_config_surface.py --check` gates the pair against drift.

## Pre-release artifact smoke test

The `Pre-release check` workflow (Actions tab, `workflow_dispatch`) builds and validates the mcpb bundle from any branch at a caller-supplied version (default `0.0.0-dev`), uploads it as a workflow artifact for manual install testing, and can optionally attach it to a deletable `v<version>-rc` pre-release. It runs the exact same steps a real release runs — both call the shared `.github/actions/build-mcpb` composite — so a green pre-release check means the release path's bundle build is green too. Project-specific artifact assertions (extra bundles, plugin manifests) belong in `packaging/pre-release-checks.sh` — an executable script the workflow runs when present, with `VERSION` and `BUNDLE` exported; the file is project-owned, and template updates never touch it.

## Tool Registration Checklist

Every MCP tool you register must carry the full set of metadata below — not just the behaviour. A tool that works but lacks a title, hints, or docs is incomplete. When adding or changing a tool, verify each item:

- **Title** — a human-readable `annotations.title` (e.g. `"Search Vault"`). Title-aware clients (notably VS Code, which honours only `title` and `readOnlyHint` among annotations) render this as the tool's label; without it they fall back to the raw machine name. Set it inline in the tool's `annotations={...}` dict.
- **Behavioural hints** — `readOnlyHint`, and where they apply `destructiveHint` / `idempotentHint`, in the same `annotations` dict. These describe side effects accurately (a destructive tool must set `destructiveHint=True`).
- **Icon** — an entry wired via `register_tool_icons(...)` or `@mcp.tool(icons=[...])` (see [Tool icons](#tool-icons)).
- **Docstring** — a Google-style docstring; FastMCP surfaces it as the tool description and per-parameter docs.
- **Docs entry** — a row in your published tools reference (e.g. `docs/tools/index.md`) so the tool is documented for users (per [Documentation Discipline](#documentation-discipline)).
- **Enforcement test** — keep a test that enumerates the registered tools and asserts each carries the metadata above (at minimum a non-empty `annotations.title`). Enumerate the *full* registry, not just the client-facing listing, so app-only / hidden tools cannot slip past. Such a test turns this checklist into a CI gate: a future tool added without a title fails loudly rather than silently shipping its machine name.

## Server Info Tool (`get_server_info`)

`make_server()` registers `get_server_info` (via `fastmcp_pvl_core.register_server_info_tool`) so operators can answer "is the latest fix actually deployed?" with a single MCP call. The default response carries `server_name`, `server_version`, and `core_version`.

For services that talk to a remote upstream (e.g. paperless, an HTTP API), wire the upstream version inside the `DOMAIN-UPSTREAM-START` / `DOMAIN-UPSTREAM-END` sentinel in `src/scholar_mcp/server.py`. Pass `upstream_version=` (a zero-arg callable returning a dict / str / None) and optionally `upstream_label="<service>"` (default `"upstream"`). The simplest pattern is a module-level upstream client (typically constructed from env vars at import time) whose version method is referenced from the callable — `CurrentContext()` is a FastMCP DI marker that only resolves inside parameter defaults, so it cannot be called directly from a zero-arg provider. The block is preserved across `copier update`.

<!-- TEMPLATE-TRACKING-START -->
## Shared Infrastructure

Shared infrastructure (auth providers, middleware stack, logging bootstrap, event store factory, CLI scaffolding, release pipeline, Docker entrypoint, nfpm packaging, mcpb bundle) lives upstream in two places:

- [`fastmcp-pvl-core`](https://github.com/pvliesdonk/fastmcp-pvl-core) — the Python library that provides `ServerConfig`, auth builders, middleware helpers, and the `make_serve_parser` / `configure_logging_from_env` / `normalise_http_path` CLI helpers.
- [`fastmcp-server-template`](https://github.com/pvliesdonk/fastmcp-server-template) — the copier template this project was generated from. Ships the CI/release workflows, `Dockerfile`, `packaging/nfpm.yaml`, `packaging/mcpb/*`, `scripts/bump_manifests.py`, server.py skeleton, and this very section of CLAUDE.md.

Fixes and improvements to shared code land in those repos and propagate here via `copier update` against the template's latest tag — run manually or via the weekly `.github/workflows/copier-update.yml` cron. Starter files listed in `_skip_if_exists` (e.g. `packaging/mcpb/*`, the `tools.py` / `resources.py` / `prompts.py` / `domain.py` scaffolds, `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE`) are written once and require manual reconciliation on template updates; `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and `scripts/bump_manifests.py` are deliberately *not* among them — all four are re-rendered on update, and only content inside their domain sentinels survives (`DOMAIN-START` / `DOMAIN-END` in the two Markdown files, `DOMAIN-HOOKS` in the pre-commit config, `DOMAIN-MANIFESTS-HELPERS` / `DOMAIN-MANIFESTS` in the bumper) — review `_skip_if_exists` in the template's `copier.yml` if you need to force-sync a file. Domain-specific code (tools, resources, prompts, and the fields and logic inside the `CONFIG-FIELDS-START` / `CONFIG-FIELDS-END`, `CONFIG-FROM-ENV-START` / `CONFIG-FROM-ENV-END`, and `CONFIG-VALIDATE-START` / `CONFIG-VALIDATE-END` sentinels) stays in this repo.

## Contributing fixes upstream

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the three-tier routing (library to `fastmcp-pvl-core`, template to `fastmcp-server-template`, domain to this repo), the issue/PR discipline, and the uncertainty rule. CONTRIBUTING.md is the single source; this section is a pointer.

If a conflict marker appears in a copier-update bot PR, the conflict itself often signals a template bug — investigate whether the template's version needs fixing before resolving locally.

## Key Patterns
<!-- DOMAIN-START -->

- Library is sync; MCP layer uses `asyncio.to_thread()` for blocking calls
- Write tools tagged `tags={"write"}`, hidden via `mcp.disable(tags={"write"})` in read-only mode
- All tools have MCP annotations (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `openWorldHint`)
- Auth: `build_auth(config.server)` resolved in `make_server()` (MultiAuth when both bearer and OIDC are configured); `_build_bearer_auth()` / `_build_oidc_auth()` are retained backward-compat wrappers used only by tests
- `_ENV_PREFIX` in `config.py` controls all env var names — change once, affects everything
- **Async task queue**: S2 tools try once (`retry=False`); on 429 `RateLimitedError`, queue with retries for background execution. PDF tools always queue (unless cache hit). `TaskQueue` lives in `ServiceBundle.tasks`.
- **Tool queueing pattern**: extract tool logic into `async def _execute(*, retry=True) -> str`, try with `retry=False`, catch `RateLimitedError` and `bundle.tasks.submit(_execute(retry=True))`
