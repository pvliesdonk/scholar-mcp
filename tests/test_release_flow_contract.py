"""Guards for the knope release-PR flow's contract (fastmcp-server-template#406).

The only release-contract suite since the Phase-2 swap deleted
python-semantic-release together with its ``tests/test_release_contract.py``:
this file guards the knope flow, which the same swap armed by removing
``[tool.semantic_release]`` from ``pyproject.toml`` (an invariant asserted
below — the workflows' interlock step refuses if the block reappears).

The invariants mirror the retired PSR suite's intent, respecified for the
release-PR model:

- ``knope.toml`` and ``scripts/stamp_manifests.py`` are two halves of one
  mechanism — knope's ``versioned_files`` own ``pyproject.toml`` alone, the
  stamp Command owns ``uv.lock``'s self-version entry (every release, PEP
  440 canonical spelling — uv re-locks would rewrite a SemVer-spelled entry
  and break knope's version-agreement requirement) and the install-channel
  manifests (stable only), and a stamp declared in one half only must fail
  here rather than ship a stale file (the #325 failure shape, carried
  over).
- The stamp script is fail-loud and atomic (the markdown-vault-mcp#1083
  lesson: no warn-and-continue): a stable version moves every published
  pin, a pre-release moves ``uv.lock`` alone and leaves the manifests
  byte-identical, and a missing or malformed pin exits non-zero naming the
  file.
- The promotion guard runs in two layers (release-vision D10): at prepare
  time between the prep commit and the push/PR steps (a drifted promotion
  never becomes a mergeable PR), and again BEFORE knope's Release step (a
  refusal must leave no tag behind).  It admits only release stamps plus
  ``docs/releases/**`` (migration M6).
- Committed pins may equal the last stable release OR the version the
  current diff prepares — a stable release PR is exactly the state the old
  tag-coupled asserts would reject, and under the release-PR model it must
  pass CI.  ``prepared`` counts only when it is itself a stable ``X.Y.Z``:
  an rc in ``pyproject.toml`` must never make an rc pin in the published
  manifests pass CI (the markdown-vault-mcp#1053 class).
- Tags-absent behavior fails loudly only when the repo demonstrably has
  releases (``CHANGELOG.md`` carries version sections) while no tags are
  visible — the template#387 failure mode is a tag-less checkout of a
  tagged repo, not a tag-less repo; a fresh render keeps its skip.

# `publish-registry` is the LAST job of a release and the only place the MCP
# Registry's limits are enforced.  A description over 100 characters passes
# every earlier gate, publishes PyPI / Docker / the plugin, and then fails the
# registry entry alone (scholar-mcp v1.9.1).  The template's `copier copy`
# validator guards the initial answer; this guards later hand edits to
# `server.json`, which copier never re-checks.
