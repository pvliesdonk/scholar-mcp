"""Guards for the background-task backend wiring in `make_server`.

`SCHOLAR_MCP_TASKS_URL` is documented automatically — the config-surface
generator reads it from `fastmcp_pvl_core.server_config_surface()`, whether or
not anything wires it.  Documentation without wiring is exactly how a feature
ships inert, so these tests assert the wiring itself: that `make_server` calls
`configure_task_backend`, and that the config it passes is this project's, not
a default-constructed stand-in.

That the configured backend also *receives* work is a separate claim, and a
newer one: until the slow tools were registered dual-mode (#298) nothing on
this server was task-capable, so the queue was reachable and empty.
`tests/test_jobs_wiring.py` asserts that half.

The assertions are on `fastmcp.settings.docket`, which is where
`configure_task_backend` writes.  Resolution order (pvl-core ADR 0002 §4.2)
is core's to own; what belongs here is proof the template reaches it.
