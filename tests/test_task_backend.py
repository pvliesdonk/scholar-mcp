"""Guards for the background-task backend wiring in `make_server`.

`SCHOLAR_MCP_TASKS_URL` is documented automatically — the config-surface
generator reads it from `fastmcp_pvl_core.server_config_surface()`, whether or
not anything wires it.  Documentation without wiring is exactly how a feature
ships inert, so these tests assert the wiring itself: that `make_server` calls
`configure_task_backend` on the very server it returns, and that the config
it passes is this project's, not a default-constructed stand-in.

The assertions are on the `TasksExtension` the helper registers and returns —
`configure_task_backend(mcp, ...)` constructs the SEP-2663 tasks extension
with the resolved backend and registers it on `mcp`.  FastMCP exposes no
public read accessor for registered extensions, so a spy wraps the server
module's `configure_task_backend` binding to capture the return value; the
spy calls the real pvl-core helper, so resolution and registration still
run unchanged.  Resolution order (pvl-core ADR 0002 §4.2, as revised for
FastMCP 4) is core's to own; what belongs here is proof the template
reaches it.
