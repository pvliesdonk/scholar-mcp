"""Domain-specific config-wizard tests for Scholar MCP.

This file is owned by the generated project (kept across ``copier update`` via
``_skip_if_exists``). The template seeds it once with a single skipped
placeholder test; add browser assertions here that depend on *this project's*
``wizard-spec.json`` — e.g. that a specific field renders, that a chosen option
emits the expected env var, or that a guard message appears. The generic
framework tests live in ``test_config_wizard_smoke.py`` (template-owned) and
must not be edited here.

See ``test_config_wizard_smoke.py`` for the page/browser fixtures to import.
