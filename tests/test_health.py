"""Contract tests for the liveness and readiness routes ``make_server`` wires.

Template-owned. The routes themselves are ``fastmcp_pvl_core``'s and are
tested there; what this file pins is the *wiring* — that the scaffold
registers them under http alone, at the prefix the mount path implies —
because that is what ``compose.yml``'s probe and an operator's
load balancer depend on, and a scaffold that quietly stopped registering
them would still pass every MCP-level test.

Every test is synchronous and builds its server before probing it:
``make_server`` finalises the instructions synchronously and refuses to run
inside an event loop, so the probe, not the construction, is what runs under
``asyncio.run``.
