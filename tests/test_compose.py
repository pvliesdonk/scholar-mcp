"""Contract tests for the shipped ``compose.yml``.

Template-owned and generic: nothing here reads a project-specific value that
is not already in the file. ``compose.yml`` is re-rendered on every ``copier
update`` and is the first file an operator opens, so the invariants that make
it *work out of the box* are asserted rather than assumed — no test covered it
between the commit that created it and the one that added this file, which is
how it came to publish no ports, declare no health check, and route a reverse
proxy off the server's bind address (template #551 / #552).

Deliberately not asserted: anything needing a Docker daemon. ``docker compose
config`` runs in CI's container job (which already builds and runs the image),
not in this unit lane.
