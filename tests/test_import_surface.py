"""Guard for the public import surface of the `scholar_mcp` package root.

A change that removes or renames a name importable from the package root is a
breaking change to the public library interface, and must be marked as such
(`feat!:` / `fix!:`, or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer) so the release pipeline
cuts a major.  Historically this class of break shipped unmarked: the author
sees an internal refactor, downstream consumers see `ImportError`.  These tests
make the surface mechanical — the project-owned snapshot
`tests/public_import_surface.txt` is the expected set of names, and any drift
between it and the real, imported package fails at PR time with instructions.

The surface definition: every non-underscore name in ``dir(package)`` or
``__all__`` that resolves via ``getattr``, enumerated in a fresh interpreter.
``dir()`` + ``getattr`` (rather than a static ``__all__`` read) is deliberate —
a root that re-exports through a lazy PEP 562 ``__getattr__`` map still counts,
and a minimal root exporting nothing yields an empty surface.  The fresh
interpreter keeps the result independent of whatever submodules earlier tests
happened to import.

Ownership: this file is template-owned (re-rendered on `copier update`); the
snapshot is project-owned (seeded once, then yours).  Regenerate it with::

    uv run python tests/test_import_surface.py --update
