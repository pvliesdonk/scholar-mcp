"""Contract tests for one-line log output in the shipped deployments.

Neither a container's stderr nor journald is a terminal. Rich therefore falls
back to 80 columns, and a structured request-log record is longer than what
its own time, level and source columns leave, so every record wraps across
three space-padded lines — unreadable in ``docker logs`` / ``journalctl``, and
unparseable by a collector (template #608). Both shipped deployments turn Rich
off instead, which restores one line per record.

That fix is a single environment default in each of two files, easy to lose in
a ``copier update`` conflict and invisible until someone reads the logs, so it
is asserted here rather than only in the pipeline that builds the image. The
matching runtime proof — that the running container's log really is one line
per record — lives in CI's container job, which needs a Docker daemon this
lane does not have.
