"""Contract tests: the shipped deployments pin no log format.

Neither a container's stderr nor journald is a terminal. pvl-core (>= 8)
therefore renders one JSON object per record in both places with nothing
configured: ``SCHOLAR_MCP_LOG_FORMAT`` unset means Rich on a terminal
and JSON everywhere else. Before that, the image and the packaged unit set
``FASTMCP_ENABLE_RICH_LOGGING=false`` to get one line per record (template
#608 / #609); the variable no longer exists, and a default that came back
through a ``copier update`` conflict would be dead weight at best and, if
it pinned ``SCHOLAR_MCP_LOG_FORMAT`` instead, would take the choice
away from the deployment's own ``.env`` or ``/etc/scholar-mcp/env``.

So the contract is an absence, asserted here because it is invisible until
someone reads the logs. The matching runtime proof — that a running
container's log really is one JSON object per line — lives in CI's
container job, which needs a Docker daemon this lane does not have.
