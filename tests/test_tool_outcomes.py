"""Every registered tool ends through pvl-core's tool boundary (template-owned).

A tool call that raises anything but a ``ToolError`` reaches FastMCP's own
handler: an ERROR traceback there, and under ``mask_error_details`` a model
that learns nothing about what to do next.  ``fastmcp_pvl_core.tool_boundary``
turns such an exception into one logged server fault and a fixed message
telling the model the request was fine; the ``designing-tool-outcomes`` skill
says how to raise every other outcome.  This test fails a tool registered
without the boundary, so the rule is a build gate rather than a convention.

The registry is enumerated through ``local_provider``, not a client listing,
so a tool hidden by ``SCHOLAR_MCP_TOOLS_DENY``, disabled in code, or
visible to an MCP App only is checked too.  The server is built once per
transport, because a ``DOMAIN-WIRING`` block may register tools for HTTP
alone.  A tool that is not a ``FunctionTool`` has no function to wrap and
fails too: it cannot carry the boundary.
