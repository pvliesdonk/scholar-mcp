"""Guards for the template-owned `config.py` customization contract.

`config.py` is template-owned (re-rendered on every `copier update`, not in
`_skip_if_exists`).  Its three domain sentinels — `CONFIG-FIELDS`,
`CONFIG-FROM-ENV`, `CONFIG-VALIDATE` — are the ONLY copier-safe places for
domain content; anything a project puts outside them lands in template-owned
prose and is at the mercy of the next merge.

These tests assert the contract those sentinels promise, so a template edit
that silently breaks it fails here rather than in every downstream.
