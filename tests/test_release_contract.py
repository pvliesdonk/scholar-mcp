"""Guards for the release-commit contract between PSR and the manifest bumper.

`pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.semantic_release] assets` list and
`scripts/bump_manifests.py` are two halves of one mechanism: PSR stages every
path in `assets` into the release commit, and the bumper is what actually
rewrites the version inside those paths.  Declare a path in one half only and
the release still succeeds — it just ships a file whose version lags the tag.

That is not hypothetical.  v3.1.0 (#298) added `uv.lock` to `assets` and a
`_bump_lockfile()` to the bumper in one change, but the script was
`_skip_if_exists` at the time while `pyproject.toml` re-renders, so instances
with a pre-existing extended copy took the `assets` half alone.  Their release
commits shipped a lockfile whose self entry lagged `pyproject.toml`, which made
`uv lock --check` fail on `main` and turned every `uv sync` into a workspace
mutation (#325, #326).  The script is template-owned now, with
`DOMAIN-MANIFESTS` seams for a project's own manifests; these tests are what
keeps the two halves honest for anything added through those seams.

A second invariant joined in template#345: the bumper must never pin a version
the release will not publish.  Pre-releases skip PyPI, the MCP registry, and
the marketplace publish, so on a pre-release run the manifests that name a
published artifact (`server.json` and the Claude Code plugin pair) must stay
at the last published stable, while `uv.lock` — which tracks `pyproject.toml`,
not PyPI — must still move.  The behavioral tests below run the real script
against a sandbox repo root and assert both directions: a stable version moves
everything, a pre-release version moves only the lockfile.

A third invariant joined in template#350: PSR's changelog writing has two
halves that fail silently when either is missing.  `update` mode (the v10
default) inserts version sections only at the insertion flag, so the config
must name the flag and `CHANGELOG.md` must carry it — a flag-less changelog is
never written, with no error.  And `changelog_file` must sit in its supported
location (`changelog.default_templates`), not the deprecated bare
`changelog.changelog_file` key.  The changelog tests below pin both halves.

A fourth invariant joined in template#375: the two behavioral tests above
prove the *bumper* never writes a pre-release pin, but nothing read the
committed manifests themselves.  The stable-pin test below does, so a bad
pin that arrives by hand edit or a half-applied update — outside the bumper
— still fails.
